## Purpose

*The Git Guide* is a compact & boiled down Git reference designed for everybody. It was born out of frustration with existing Git references that are over the roof or inadequate, or both.

This compilation project comes from FAQ & Git Essentials for daily usage through Google, StackOverflow, reference books and oftentimes the [Git Official Documentation.](https://git-scm.com/doc)
