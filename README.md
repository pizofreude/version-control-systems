# **Version Control Systems**

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away... there are 3 types of Version Control Systems (VCSs):

1. Local VCS
2. Centralized VCS
3. Distributed VCS

These are the systems people actually used to organized their product lifecycle management, i.e. code, projects, files, simulation data and etcetera pp.

The intention of this page creation is to summarize the key notes for all VCSs & git related topics.
